<a href="#top">Go To Top</a>
<p align="left"><font size="3">A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithemetic or logical operations. Since a seaquence of operations can be readily changed,the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.</font></p>

<a id="CPU"><h4>CPU</h4></a>
<p align="left"><font size="3">A central processing unit(CPU),also reffered to as a central processor unit,is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithemetical,logical,and input/output operations of the system.The term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s.The form,design,and implimentation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history,but their fundemental operation remains much the same.</font></p>

<a id="ALU"><h4>ALU</h4></a>
<p align="left"><font size="3">In computing, an arithemetic and logic unit(ALU)is a digital circuit that performs integer arithemetic and logical operations. The ALU is afundemental building block of the central processing unit of a computer and even the simplest microprocessors contain one for purpose such as maintaining timers. The processors found inside modern CPUs and graphics processing units(GPUs)accomodate very powerful and very complex ALUs;a single component may contain a number of ALUs.</font></p>

<a id="programming languages"><h3>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h3></a>
<p align="left"><font size="3">A programming language is aformal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kind of output. Programming languages generally consists of instructions for a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that impliment specific algorithms.</font></p>

<a id="C"><h4>C</h4></a>
<p align="left"><font size="3">C is one of the most widely used programming languages of all time,and C compilers are available for the majority of available computer architectures and operating systems. C is a general purpose,imperative computer programming language,supporting structured programming,lexical variable scope and recursion,while a static type system prevents many unintended operations.</font></p>

<a id="C++"><h4>C++</h4></a>
<p align="left"><font size="3">C++(pronounced see plus plus) is a programming language that is general purpose,statically typed, free-form,multi-paradigm and compiled. It is regarded as an intermediate level language,as it comprises both high-level and low-level language features. </font></p>

<a id="DBMS"><h3>DBMS</h3></a>
<p align="left"><font size="3">A database management system (DBMS) is system software for creating and managing databases. The DBMS provides users and programmers with a systematic way to create, retrieve, update and manage data.</font></p>

<a id="RDBMS"><h4>RDBMS</h4></a>
<p align="left"><font size="3">A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model invented by Edgar F. Codd, of IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory. Most databases in widespread use are based on the relational database model.</font></p>


<a id="OODBMS"><h4>OODBMS</h4></a>
<p align="left"><font size="3">An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) is a database management system that supports the creation and modeling of data as objects. OODBMS also includes support for classes of objects and the inheritance of class properties, and incorporates methods, subclasses and their objects.</font></p>

<a id="HDBMS"><h4>HDBMS</h4></a>
<p align="left"><font size="3">HDBMS (Hierarchical Database Management System) is a type of DBMS that supports a hierarchical data model. Example HDBMS Systems: Lotus Notes (the most popular HDBMS in use today) IMS - IBM's Information Management System (first HDBMS).</font></p>


<a id="NWDBMS"><h4>NWDBMS</h4></a>
<p align="left"><font size="3">A network database is a type of database model wherein multiple member records or files can be linked to multiple owner files and vice versa. The model can be viewed as an upside-down tree where each member information is the branch linked to the owner, which is the bottom of the tree.</font></p>
